# OctoFit Tracker architecture

OctoFit Tracker is a three-tier application for a school fitness program. The starter code includes API contracts and intentionally incomplete implementation points so you can use GitHub Copilot agent mode in a test-driven loop.

![Three-tier OctoFit architecture](../.github/images/octofit-architecture.svg)

## Tier boundaries

- **Presentation tier**: React 19, Vite, React Router, Bootstrap, and a shared API client in `octofit-tracker/frontend/src`.
- **Logic tier**: Express and TypeScript routes/services in `octofit-tracker/backend/src` expose `/api/*` behavior on port `8000`.
- **Data tier**: Mongoose models and seed data in `octofit-tracker/backend/src/models` and `src/scripts/seed.ts` persist to MongoDB on port `27017`.

## Ports and environment rules

- MongoDB: `27017`
- Express API: `8000`
- Vite frontend: `5173`
- The browser calls relative `/api` paths. Vite proxies them to `http://localhost:8000`, so the unauthenticated API port stays private in Codespaces. `VITE_API_BASE_URL` can override the base URL.

## API contract

| Capability | Method and path | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity tracking | `GET /api/activities`, `POST /api/activities` | List and create valid activity records. POST accepts `userId`, `teamId`, `type`, and `minutes`; `userId` and `teamId` must be well-formed IDs for an existing user and team; otherwise respond with a deliberate 4xx (never a 500 from a cast error). A created activity stores the submitted `user`, `team`, `type`, and `minutes` plus computed `points` and `occurredAt`. |
| Teams | `GET /api/teams`, `POST /api/teams` | List and create teams with members. Created and listed teams keep the submitted `name` and `mascot`. Reject a team without a name with `400`. |
| Leaderboard | `GET /api/leaderboard` | Return teams ordered by the sum of their activity points, highest first. Each entry has `teamName`, `totalPoints`, and a 1-based `rank`. |
| Workout suggestions | `GET /api/workouts/suggestions/:userEmail` | Recommend workouts from recent activity patterns for the matching seeded user's email address. The first suggestion's `focus` matches that user's goal or recent activity, with a `reason` explaining why. An email with no matching user returns a deliberate 4xx (for example, `404`). |

## Implementation decisions

- Presentation tier decision: Keep rendering and interaction in React; use the shared API client with relative `/api` paths, and expose loading, empty, and error states accessibly.
- Logic tier decision: Keep HTTP handling and request validation in Express routes/services. Return deliberate 4xx responses for invalid or unknown input rather than leaking database errors as 500s.
- Data tier decision: Use Mongoose models for persisted fields, references, and required-field validation. Keep seed data representative and idempotent.
- Activity tracking approach: Validate that submitted user and team IDs are well-formed and refer to existing records. Persist the submitted user, team, type, and minutes, and compute points and occurrence time on the server.
- Team management approach: Require a name, preserve the submitted name and mascot, and persist the members as user references.
- Leaderboard approach: Sum activity points by team, sort by total points descending, and return each team name, total, and 1-based rank.
- Workout suggestions approach: Find the user by email and base the first suggestion's focus on their goal or recent activity, with a reason. Return a deliberate 4xx when no user matches.

## Test plan

- Data-tier tests: `npm run test:data --prefix octofit-tracker/backend` checks required model fields, references, and seed behavior. Missing validation or schema fields fail these contracts. **Baseline:** 4 failed, 1 passed; the user, team, activity, and workout model contracts fail, while seed behavior passes.
- API tests: `npm run test:api --prefix octofit-tracker/backend` checks activity/team creation and validation, leaderboard aggregation, and workout recommendations. Failures indicate incorrect status codes, response data, or business logic. **Baseline:** 4 failed; invalid requests return `501` rather than `400`, the leaderboard is empty, and the first workout suggestion does not match the expected user activity pattern.
- Frontend tests: `npm test --prefix octofit-tracker/frontend` checks API-backed page content and accessible loading, empty, and error states. Failures indicate a missing or incorrect page/API-client behavior or state handling. **Baseline:** 15 failed, covering content/API requests and loading, empty, and error states across the pages.
- Backend build: `npm run build --prefix octofit-tracker/backend` checks backend TypeScript compilation; failures indicate type or build errors. Not yet run.
- Frontend build: `npm run build --prefix octofit-tracker/frontend` checks frontend compilation and bundling; failures indicate type or build errors. Not yet run.
